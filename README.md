# svelte-ssr

This is a cloneable template for creating interactive articles with Distill and Svelte.

```
npm install -g degit # you only need to do this once

degit distillpub/svelte-template your-article
cd your-article
```

You can then:
```
npm install

npm run build

npm run serve
```

##Goals

A reusable, reactive template for authoring interactive articles for https://distill.pub.

##Features

1. Server-side rendering for markup with client-side hydration of javascript.

2. Support for a central data store.

3. Uglify during production. (TODO)

4. Image asset pipeline. (TODO)
